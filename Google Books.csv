6,Educational Psychology,['L.S. Vygotsky'],"When this classic book was first published in 1926, L.S. Vygotsky was well on his way to becoming one of the leading intellectuals in Russia. His study of the psychology of education led him to believe that the child should be the main figure in the educational process - and the efforts of the teacher should be directed toward organizing, not dictating, the child's development. ""The educational process must be based on the student's individual activity ..."" he states in Educational Psychology, ""... and the art of education should involve nothing more than guiding and monitoring this activity."" At a time when most education consisted of rote memorization and thwacks across the wrist with a ruler, these ideas were considered quite radical. Today's educators can find much that is of use in the pages of Educational Psychology. Vygotsky addresses many issues that are still relevant in the 1990s - abnormal social behavior, the nurturing of creativity and reasoning, problems with attention and memory - in a bold and opinionated fashion that is sure to delight educators as well as lovers of classical Russian writing. Psychologists will also find the book useful for its fascinating glimpses into the study of psychology in the early twentieth century.",1997-08-11,NA
7,Science Fiction and Psychology,['Gavin Miller'],"The psychologist may appear in science fiction as the herald of utopia or dystopia; literary studies have used psychoanalytic theories to interpret science fiction; and psychology has employed science fiction as an educational medium. Science Fiction and Psychology goes beyond such incidental observations and engagements to offer an in-depth exploration of science fiction literature's varied use of psychological discourses, beginning at the birth of modern psychology in the late nineteenth century and concluding with the ascendance of neuroscience in the late twentieth century. Rather than dwelling on psychoanalytic readings, this literary investigation combines with history of psychology to offer attentive textual readings that explore five key psychological schools: evolutionary psychology, psychoanalysis, behaviourism, existential-humanism, and cognitivism. The varied functions of psychological discourses in science fiction are explored, whether to popularise and prophesy, to imagine utopia or dystopia, to estrange our everyday reality, to comment on science fiction itself, or to abet (or resist) the spread of psychological wisdom. Science Fiction and Psychology also considers how psychology itself has made use of science fiction in order to teach, to secure legitimacy as a discipline, and to comment on the present.",2020-01-31,NA
8,The Principles of Psychology,['William James'],"The Principles of Psychology is a two-volume introduction to the study of the human mind. Based on his classroom lessons and first published in 1890, James has gathered together what he feels to be the most interesting and most accessible information for the beginning student. Psychology, according to James, deals with thoughts and feelings as its facts and does not attempt to determine where such things come from. This would be the realm of metaphysics, and he is careful to avoid crossing over from science into philosophy. This first volume contains discussions of the brain, methods for analyzing behavior, thought, consciousness, attention, association, time, and memory. Anyone wanting a thorough introduction to psychology will find this work useful and engaging. American psychologist and philosopher WILLIAM JAMES (1842-1910), brother of novelist Henry James, was a groundbreaking researcher at Harvard University and one of the most popular thinkers of the 19th century. Among his many works are Human Immortality (1898) and The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature (1902).",2007-04,NA
9,The Book of Moods,['Lauren Martin'],"""Hilariously witty, unflinchingly honest, and brimming with hope."" Bobbi Brown ""A fascinating, thorough, and truly helpful book. I loved it!"" Sarah Knight, New York Times bestselling author of Calm the F*ck Down The Happiness Project meets So Sad Today in this ""hilariously witty, unflinchingly honest"" book from the beloved founder of Words of Women, contemplating the nature of negative emotions, and the insights that allowed her to take back control. Five years ago, Lauren Martin was sure something was wrong with her. She had a good job in New York, an apartment in Brooklyn, a boyfriend, yet every day she wrestled with feelings of inferiority, anxiety and irritability. It wasn't until a chance encounter with a (charming, successful) stranger who revealed that she also felt these things, that Lauren set out to better understand the hold that these moods had on her, how she could change them, and began to blog about the wisdom she uncovered. It quickly exploded into an international online community of women who felt like she did: lost, depressed, moody, and desirous of change. Inspired by her audience to press even deeper, The Book of Moods shares Lauren's journey to infuse her life with a sense of peace and stability. With observations that will resonate and inspire, she dives into the universal triggers every woman faces - whether it's a comment from your mother, the relentless grind at your job, days when you wish the mirror had a Valencia filter, or all of the above. Blending cutting-edge science, timeless philosophy, witty anecdotes and effective forms of self-care, Martin has written a powerful, intimate, and incredibly relatable chronicle of transformation, proving that you really can turn your worst moods into your best life.",2020-12-10,NA

15,Psychology of Stress,['Kimberly V. Oxington'],"Stress is a physical response to an undesirable situation. Mild stress can result from missing the bus, standing in a long line at the store or getting a parking ticket. Stress can also be severe. Divorce, family problems, an assault, or the death of a loved one, for example, can be devastating. One of the most common sources of both mild and severe stress is work. Stress can be short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic). Acute stress is a reaction to an immediate threat -- either real or perceived. Chronic stress involves situations that aren't short-lived, such as relationship problems, workplace pressures, and financial or health worries. Stress is an unavoidable consequence of life. As Hans Selye (who coined the term as it is currently used) noted, ""Without stress, there would be no life"". However, just as distress can cause disease, it seems plausible that there are good stresses that promote wellness. Stress is not always necessarily harmful. Winning a race or an election can be just as stressful as losing, or more so, but may trigger very different biological responses. Increased stress results in increased productivity up to a point. This new book deals with the dazzling complexity of this good-bad phenomenon and presents up-to-date research from throughout the world.",2005,NA

25,Quiet,['Susan Cain'],"Quiet by Susan Cain will change how you think about introverts forever A Sunday Times and New York Times Bestseller Our lives are driven by a fact that most of us can't name and don't understand. It defines who our friends and lovers are, which careers we choose, and whether we blush when we're embarrassed. That fact is whether we're an introvert or an extrovert. The introvert/extrovert divide is the most fundamental dimension of personality. And at least a third of us are on the introverted side. Some of the world's most talented people are introverts. Without them we wouldn't have the Apple computer, the theory of relativity and Van Gogh's sunflowers. Yet extroverts have taken over. Shyness, sensitivity and seriousness are often seen as being negative. Introverts feel reproached for being the way they are. In Quiet, Susan Cain shows how the brain chemistry of introverts and extroverts differs, and how society misunderstands and undervalues introverts. She gives introverts the tools to better understand themselves and take full advantage of their strengths. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with real stories, Quiet will permanently change how we see introverts - and how you see yourself. 'I can't get Quiet out of my head. It is an important book - so persuasive and timely and heartfelt it should inevitably effect change in schools and offices' Jon Ronson, The Guardian 'Susan Cain's Quiet has sparked a quiet revolution. In our booming culture, hers is a still, small voice that punches above its weight. Perhaps rather than sitting back and asking people to speak up, managers and company leaders might lean forward and listen' Megan Walsh, The Times 'Quiet is a very timely book, and Cain's central thesis is fresh and important. Maybe the extrovert ideal is no longer as powerful as it was; perhaps it is time we all stopped to listen to the still, small voice of calm' Daisy Goodwin, The Sunday Times Susan Cain is the owner of The Negotiation Company, a firm that trains people in negotiation and communication skills.

13,Media Psychology,['David Giles'],"Media Psychology examines the impact that 21st century media use has on human behavior, from teenage crushes on pop stars to soap fandom in adulthood. It brings together North American communication research with European media research in a variety of disciplines--psychology, sociology, communication and media studies--and in doing so, maps out the territory for media psychology. David Giles argues that psychologists have been guilty of ignoring the influence of the media over the last century, seeing it at best as a minor nuisance that will eventually go away. However, with the increasing prevalence of new electronic forms of mass communication, the media seem to have a greater influence than ever over our daily lives. In this book, Dr. Giles tackles the traditional topics of media psychology--sex, violence, advertising--along with sections on developmental aspects of media influence and the psychology of the audience. He also examines a number of specific media genres--news, sports, soaps, and the increasingly popular audience participation media, such as ""reality"" and ""lifestyle"" television. In addition, he asks what light psychology can shed on the popularity of these genres and the response of their audiences. Finally, there are chapters on the increasing influence of the Internet and on the representation of psychology and psychologists themselves in the media.",2003-04-02,NA

25,Cognitive Psychology,['Lawrence W. Barsalou'],"This text presents the basic concepts of modern cognitive psychology in a succinct and accessible manner. Empirical results, theoretical developments, and current issues are woven around basic concepts to produce coherent accounts of research areas. Barsalou's primary goal is to equip readers with a conceptual vocabulary that acquaints them with the general approach of cognitive psychology and allows them to follow more technical discussions elsewhere. In meeting this goal, he discusses the traditional work central to modern thinking and reviews current work relevant to cognitive science. Besides focusing on research and theory in cognitive psychology, Barsalou also addresses its fundamental assumptions. Because the cognitive approach to psychology is somewhat subtle, often misunderstood, and sometimes controversial, it is essential for a text on cognitive psychology to address the assumptions that underlie it. Therefore, three of the eleven chapters address the ""meta- assumptions"" that govern research and theory in cognitive psychology. These meta-chapters provide a deeper understanding of the content areas and a clearer vision of what cognitive psychologists are trying to accomplish. The remaining eight ""content"" chapters cover the central topics in cognitive psychology. This book will be of value to a variety of audiences. Ideal for researchers in computer science, linguistics, philosophy, anthropology, and neuroscience who wish to acquaint themselves with cognitive psychology, it may also be used as a text for courses in cognitive science and cognitive psychology.

Psychology's aim is to explain mental phenomena by describing the underlying processes, systems, and mechanisms that give rise to them. These hidden causal levers underlie all of our mental feats, including our richest conscious perceptions, our most subtle chains of reasoning, and our widest-ranging plans and actions. While the phenomena of mind are intimately related to events occurring in the brain, these psychological explanations are, we will argue, distinct and autonomous from explanations in terms of neural processes and mechanisms. According to the view we present here, psychology and neuroscience are different enterprises. We certainly wouldn't claim that our ever-increasing understanding of how the brain works has nothing to say to psychology: on the contrary, they are complimentary, since neuroscience can provide invaluable input to psychological theorizing (and vice versa, a point that we think is not stressed often enough). But our task will be to give a thorough account of the scope, methods, content, and prospects for a distinctive science of our mental lives""--",2015-01-15,NA

Virologists predict that the next pandemic could occur in the coming years, probably from some form of influenza, with potentially devastating consequences. Vaccinations, if available, and behavioral methods are vital for stemming the spread of infection. However, remarkably little attention has been devoted to the psychological factors that influence the spread of pandemic infection and the associated emotional distress and social disruption. Psychological factors are important for many reasons. They play a role in nonadherence to vaccination and hygiene programs, and play an important role in how people cope with the threat of infection and associated losses. Psychological factors are important for understanding and managing societal problems associated with pandemics, such as the spreading of excessive fear, stigmatization, and xenophobia that occur when people are threatened with infection. This book offers the first comprehensive analysis of the psychology of pandemics. It describes the psychological reactions to pandemics, including maladaptive behaviors, emotions, and defensive reactions, and reviews the psychological vulnerability factors that contribute to the spreading of disease and distress. It also considers empirically supported methods for addressing these problems, and outlines the implications for public health planning.",2019-10-07,NA

They focus respectively on input, stored, and fedback information. Chapters 5 (phylogenetic approach) and 6 (ontogenetic approach) place psychology firmly where it belongs as the study of organisms rather than of mechanisms. Development from animal to human and from child to adult is emancipation from tyranny of environment. Chapter 7 (pathological approach) explores functional disorders of person-in-environment, since the nervous system “knows” its environment. Chapter 8 (phenomenological approach) deals with the further complexity that the nervous system can be viewed from the inside (experience) as well as from the outside (behavior). Chapters 9 (simulation approach) and 10 (mediational approach) focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and intelligence amplification (IA). Computers can be used to emulate or to extend human intelligence. Chapters 11 (biological approach) and 12 (sociological approach) deal with the complexities arising from the fact that the nervous system is embedded in a hierarchy of systems within systems. They focus on emergence from the level below psychology (biology) and reduction from the level above (sociology). Each approach will cast some light on the topic from its peculiar perspective.

The contributors to this volume believe that, while virtually every theoretically engaged psychologist today openly rejects positivism in both its 19th century and 20th century forms, it is indispensable to look at positivism from all sides and to appraise its role and importance in order to make possible the further development of psychological theory.",1992,NA

19,Well-Being,"['Daniel Kahneman', 'Edward Diener', 'Norbert Schwarz']","The nature of well-being is one of the most enduring and elusive subjects of human inquiry. Well-Being draws upon the latest scientific research to transform our understanding of this ancient question. With contributions from leading authorities in psychology, social psychology, and neuroscience, this volume presents the definitive account of current scientific efforts to understand human pleasure and pain, contentment and despair. The distinguished contributors to this volume combine a rigorous analysis of human sensations, emotions, and moods with a broad assessment of the many factors, from heredity to nationality, that bear on our well-being. Using the tools of experimental science, the contributors confront the puzzles of human likes and dislikes. Why do we grow accustomed and desensitized to changes in our lives, both good and bad? Does our happiness reflect the circumstances of our lives or is it determined by our temperament and personality? Why do humans acquire tastes for sensations that are initially painful or unpleasant? By examining the roots of our everyday likes and dislikes, the book also sheds light on some of the more extreme examples of attraction and aversion, such as addiction and depression. Among its wide ranging inquiries, Well-Being examines systematic differences in moods and behaviors between genders, explaining why women suffer higher rates of depression and anxiety than men, but are also more inclined to express positive emotions. The book also makes international comparisons, finding that some countries' populations report higher levels of happiness than others. The contributors deploy an array of methods, from the surveys and questionnaires of social science to psychological and physiological experiments, to develop a comprehensive new approach to the study of well-being. They show how the sensory pleasures of the body can tells us something about the higher pleasures of the mind and even how the effectiveness of our immune system can depend upon the health of our social relationships.",1999-07-08,NA

This new edition of The Psychology of Happiness provides a comprehensive and up-to-date account of research into the nature of happiness. Major research developments have occurred since publication of the first edition in 1987 – here they are brought together for the first time, often with surprising conclusions. Drawing on research from the disciplines of sociology, physiology and economics as well as psychology, Michael Argyle explores the nature of positive and negative emotions, and the psychological and cognitive processes involved in their generation. Accessible and wide-ranging coverage is provided on key issues such as: the measurements and study of happiness, mental and physical health; the effect of friendship, marriage and other relationships on positive moods; happiness, mental and physical health; the effects of work, employment and leisure; and the effects of money, class and education. The importance of individual personality traits such as optimism, purpose in life, internal control and having the right kind of goals is also analysed. New to this edition is additional material on national differences, the role of humour, and the effect of religion. Are some countries happier than others? This is just one of the controversial issues addressed by the author along the way. Finally the book discusses the practical application of research in this area, such as how happiness can be enhanced, and the effects of happiness on health, altruism and sociability.

This is perhaps the leading division within the psychological study of politics today. Political Psychology: Situations, Individuals, and Cases, 2nd edition, provides a concise, readable, and conceptually organized introduction to the topic of political psychology by examining this very question. Using this situationism--dispositionism framework—which roughly parallels the concerns of social and cognitive psychology—this book focuses on such key explanatory mechanisms as behaviorism, obedience, personality, groupthink, cognition, affect, emotion, and neuroscience to explore topics ranging from voting behavior and racism to terrorism and international relations. The new edition includes a new chapter on the psychology of the media and communication. Houghton has also updated the text to analyze recent political events such as the 2012 election, and to include up-and-coming research in the areas of neuroscience, behavioral economics, and more. Houghton's clear and engaging examples directly challenge students to place themselves in both real and hypothetical situations which involve intense moral and political dilemmas.

This book provides a comprehensive overview of approaches to understanding crime and criminal behaviour, with a focus on psychological perspectives.

29,Psychology of Terrorism,"['Bruce Bongar', 'Lisa M. Brown', 'Larry E. Beutler', 'James N. Breckenridge', 'Philip G. Zimbardo']","During the past decade, we have witnessed a dramatic transformation in the nature and uses of terrorism. In the 70s, it was often repeated that terrorists ""want a lot of people watching, not a lot of people dead""; today, it is more accurate to say that terrorists want a lot of people dead, and even more people crippled by fear and grief. A major strategic intent of modern terrorists is to use larger scale physical attacks to cause stress in the general population. These changes in terrorist strategy have made it clear that we need better psychological and social responses to terrorism and man-made disasters. The psychological science needed to provide proper and effective treatment for victims of horrendous events, such as September 11th, and future potential terrorist acts, simply does not exist, so military, medical, and psychological experts must work together to improve their understanding of mass casualty terrorism. In Psychology of Terrorism leading national and international experts present the first results of this effort, including the newest findings on treatment of and clinical responses to terrorism along with their respective underlying theories. They address the history of terrorism; types and effects of weapons of mass destruction or disruption; the role of the military, government agencies, and volunteer groups in responding to terrorist threats; psychological consequences of terrorism; and treatment of special populations such as children and older adults. This volume will be an ideal text for both academic and professional courses as well as a comprehensive resource for mental health clinicians and researchers, medical care providers, educators, public health specialists, government employees, police and fire departments, and non-profit agencies that provide services and craft policy.",2006-09-07,NA
30,Coping,['C. R. Snyder'],"Most people take the process of coping for granted as they go about their daily activities. In many ways, coping is like breathing, an automatic process requiring no apparent effort. However, when people face truly threatening events--what psychologists call stressors--they become acutely aware of the coping process and respond by consciously applying their day-to-day coping skills. Coping is a fundamental psychological process, and people's skills are commensurately sophisticated. This volume builds on people's strengths and emphasizes their role as positive copers. It features techniques for preventing psychological problems and breaks from the traditional research approach, which is modeled on medicine and focuses on pathology and treatment. Collecting both award-winning research and new findings, this book may well set the agenda for research on stress and coping for the next century. These provocative and readable essays explore a variety of topics, including reality negotiation, confessing through writing, emotional intelligence, optimism, hope, mastery-oriented thinking, and more. Unlike typical self-help books available at any newsstand, this volume features the work of some of the most eminent researchers in the field. Yet like those books it is written for the general reader, as well as for the specialist, and includes numerous practical suggestions and techniques. It will prove an invaluable tool for a wide range of readers.",1999-03-25,NA

32,The Oxford Handbook of Language and Social Psychology,['Thomas M. Holtgraves'],"Language pervades everything we do as social beings. It is, in fact, difficult to disentangle language from social life, and hence its importance is often missed. The emergence of new communication technologies makes this even more striking. People come to ""know"" one another through these interactions without ever having met face-to-face. How? Through the words they use and the way they use them. The Oxford Handbook of Language and Social Psychology is a unique and innovative compilation of research that lies at the intersection of language and social psychology. Language is viewed as a social activity, and to understand this complex human activity requires a consideration of its social psychological underpinnings. Moreover, as a social activity, the use and in fact the existence of language has implications for a host of traditional social psychological processes. Hence, there is a reciprocal relationship between language and social psychology, and it is this reciprocal relationship that defines the essence of this handbook. The handbook is divided into six sections. The first two sections focus on the social underpinnings of language, that is, the social coordination required to use language, as well as the manner in which language and broad social dimensions such as culture mutually constitute one another. The next two sections consider the implications of language for a host of traditional social psychological topics, including both intraindividual (e.g., attribution) and interindividual (e.g., intergroup relations) processes. The fifth section examines the role of language in the creation of meaning, and the final section includes chapters documenting the importance of the language-social psychology interface for a number of applied areas.",2014-08-13,NA

This briefer, less expensive book presents psychology in a meaningful, manageable format that focuses on the key questions and core concepts of psychology. Introductory psychology covers such a wide range of topics and issues that it becomes difficult for readers to see the forest for the trees. To make key psychological concepts more meaningful, the authors found inspiration in a classic chess study. This study showed that experts did no better than novices at remembering the location of pieces on a chess board when they were placed randomly. Only when the patterns represented actual game situations did they make sense and therefore become more easily memorable for the experts. Clearly, meaningful patterns are easier to remember and understand than random arrangements, and Psychology applies this by presenting the field of psychology in meaningful patterns to enhance comprehension. These concepts are then applied to readers' own lives, study skills, and the world around them. Finally, Psychology integrates a cross-cultural and multicultural perspective to make psychology meaningful for everyone. For anyone interested in Introductory Psychology.",2000,NA

The text emphasizes controlled and systematic studies to explain such behavioural aspects as sensing, perceiving, modifications of human behaviour, memorizing, the recollection of past events, and affecting processes.

7,The Psychology of Risk Taking Behavior,['R.M. Trimpop'],"This book aims to help the reader to understand what motivates people to engage in risk taking behavior, such as participating in traffic, sports, financial investments, or courtship. The consequences of risk taking may be positive, or result in accidents and injuries, especially in traffic. The wealth of studies and theories (about 1000 references) is used to offer a cohesive, holistic view of risk motivation. The risk motivation theory is a dynamic state-trait model incorporating physiological, emotional and cognitive components of risk perception, processing and planning. If a deficit exists between desired and perceived risk, risk compensation behavior results. A feedback loop provides new information for the next perception-motivation-behavior process. Assumptions were tested and support was found with 120 subjects in a longitudinal study. The concepts and findings are discussed in relation to psychological theories and their meaning for our daily lives.",1994-04-28,NA
8,"Race, Racism, and Psychology",['Graham Richards'],"Race, Racism and Psychology shows how difficult it is for psychology to be an objective science, especially when dealing with issues like race. By examining psychology's treatment of race and racism issues since the nineteenth century, Graham Richards finds that the discipline has been an important site where broader cultural debates on ""race"" are played out. Topics include scientific racism in the late 1800s, negro personality studies in the US (1930-1960), Nazi racist psychology, the emergence of a US black psychology and the race and IQ controversies of the seventies.",1997,NA

Included in the book are charts correlating over a hundred psychological and spiritual schools from around the world, including Kabbalah, Vedanta, Plotinus, Teresa of Ávila, Aurobindo, Theosophy, and modern theorists such as Jean Piaget, Erik Erikson, Jane Loevinger, Lawrence Kohlberg, Carol Gilligan, Erich Neumann, and Jean Gebser.

Drawn primarily from 14th Biennial International Symposium on the Contributions of Psychology, the chapters focus on peacemaking--or the pursuit of harmony in human relations-- and peacebuilding--or equity in human relations-- with a special emphasis on voices from typically underrepresented areas in psychology, such as the Global South. In order to move beyond a Western-centered idea of peace psychology, the volume is divided into two major parts. The first half of the volume puts an emphasis on peace psychology research and praxis in a number of geohistorical contexts, including Malaysia, Northern Ireland, Thailand, and Kashmir, that bear on conflict, harmony and equity in human relations. Chapters in the second half of the volume fulfill the mandate of Biennial Symposia; namely, to create more equity in the production of peace theory and praxis by bringing forward the voices of scholars and change agents that are often unheard in peace discourses, including a number of scholars and chapters from South Africa. Additionally, throughout the chapters, the authors and editors of the volume emphasize emancipatory agendas as an important alternative to militarism and state-sponsored violence. With the aim of bringing forward voices from cultures and situations that are typically not included or highly visible in peace discourses, Enlarging the Scope of Peace Psychology in Invited and Invented Spaces: African and World-Regional Contributions is a thought-provoking, timely, and informative work.

2,Are We Free? Psychology and Free Will,"['John Baer', 'James C. Kaufman', 'Roy F. Baumeister']","Do people have free will, or this universal belief an illusion? If free will is more than an illusion, what kind of free will do people have? How can free will influence behavior? Can free will be studied, verified, and understood scientifically? How and why might a sense of free will have evolved? These are a few of the questions this book attempts to answer. People generally act as though they believe in their own free will: they don't feel like automatons, and they don't treat one another as they might treat robots. While acknowledging many constraints and influences on behavior, people nonetheless act as if they (and their neighbors) are largely in control of many if not most of the decisions they make. Belief in free will also underpins the sense that people are responsible for their actions. Psychological explanations of behavior rarely mention free will as a factor, however. Can psychological science find room for free will? How do leading psychologists conceptualize free will, and what role do they believe free will plays in shaping behavior? In recent years a number of psychologists have tried to solve one or more of the puzzles surrounding free will. This book looks both at recent experimental and theoretical work directly related to free will and at ways leading psychologists from all branches of psychology deal with the philosophical problems long associated with the question of free will, such as the relationship between determinism and free will and the importance of consciousness in free will. It also includes commentaries by leading philosophers on what psychologists can contribute to long-running philosophical struggles with this most distinctly human belief. These essays should be of interest not only to social scientists, but to intelligent and thoughtful readers everywhere.",2008-02-25,NA

24,Environmental Psychology,NA,"Bell et al’s Environmental Psychology is considered to be the most authoritative textbook available for this course. It is the only environmental psychology book to appear in five editions. It is noted for its focus on the application of science and theory to the solution of problems involving natural and altered environments. The book reviews the application of practical solutions to everyday environmental problems. The authors integrate theory, research, and application using their unifying, eclectic model to demonstrate human-environment interaction. The book reviews how we are a product of our environment, our biology, and the interaction of the two. It discusses how our physical environment such as noise and weather impact us. It also reviews how we can modify our environment through design principles such as aesthetics, and how we modify our environment when we disregard the impact other people and/or elements have on our ecological system. Each chapter addresses both micro and macro- environmental influences, including the short- and long-term effects of both. The opening chapter provides a historical context and introduces the reader to the research methods central to the discipline. The next 4 chapters introduce environmental attitudes, values, and ethics and the principles that apply to environmental assessment; models of perception & cognition, including how we process and store environmental information; and the major theories of human-environment interaction. The next 6 chapters explore a variety of environmental influences such as noise, climate, natural disasters (including the effects of pollution), crowding, and city life, and how they impact us. The next 2 chapters examine how environmental psychology principles can be applied to residences, institutional settings (i.e.schools) and work and leisure environments. The book concludes with a chapter on how we can change behavior that harms the environment. The book is intended as a text for courses on environmental psychology, environment and behavior, social ecology, architectural psychology, ecological psychology or environmental design or studies, taught in departments of psychology, sociology, environmental science, and biology.",2001,NA
25,Psychology of Emotion,"['Paula M. Niedenthal', 'François Ric']","Since the turn of the twenty-first century, the psychology of emotion has grown to become its own field of study. Because the study of emotion draws inspiration from areas of science outside of psychology, including neuroscience, psychiatry, biology, genetics, computer science, zoology, and behavioral economics, the field is now often called emotion science or affective science. A subfield of affective science is affective neuroscience, the study of the emotional brain. This revised second edition of Psychology of Emotion reviews both theory and methods in emotion science, discussing findings about the brain; the function, expression, and regulation of emotion; similarities and differences due to gender and culture; the relationship between emotion and cognition; and emotion processes in groups. Comprehensive in its scope yet eminently readable, Psychology of Emotion serves as an ideal introduction for undergraduate students to the scientific study of emotion.

4,The Social Consequences of Modern Psychology,['Hans JÃ¼rgen Eysenck'],"In The Social Consequences of Modern Psychology Eysenck takes the position that social science has real substance, and its findings ought to be applicable to social problems of our times. Although there is little that scientists can do about war and its prevention, or about social unrest and upheaval, or about strikes and other confrontations, there are a number of questions to which we can give tentative answers. This book deals with some of these questions, and finds some of the answers. Eysenck begins with a look at a paradox of modern psychology. Experimental psychologists use strictly scientific methods to investigate what to many people seem trivial and sterile problems, yet some social psychologists, psychiatrists and psychoanalysts investigate what are clearly important and socially relevant problems, but use methods and theories whose scientific rigor is doubtful at best. This paradox is artificial and unnecessary. Methods of investigation and theories and concepts enable us to combine worthwhile problems and rigorous methods. The book takes a long look at a particular problem which Eysenck investigated in depth during his illustrious lifetime. This tour de force, by one of the magisterial figures of modern psychology, is written for people as well as about people. It is not a rehash of the voluminous writings of lawyers, poets, politicians, dramatists, historians, psychiatrists and others who have felt compelled to write about these psychological matters without even a smattering of psychological knowledge. It is, instead, based on empirical investigations that are too often declared to be nonexistent by publicists and politicos. Hans J. Eysenck (1916-1997) was professor of psychology at the University of London and the director of its psychological department at the Institute of Psychiatry. He was best known for his experimental researches in the field of personality. Among his many books are Rebel with a Cause, Dimensions of Personality, The Dynamics of Anxiety and Hysteria, Intelligence, and Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire, all published by Transaction. Sybil B. G. Eysenck, wife of the late author, is co-director of Personality Investigations, Publications and Services (PIPS), an organization devoted to the promotion of the writings and research of Hans J.

Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results. If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights. Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field. Learn how to: • make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); • overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; • design your environment to make success easier; • get back on track when you fall off course; ...and much more.

Fear is a reaction to danger that involves both the mind and body. It serves a protective purpose -- signalling us of danger and preparing us to deal with it. The major components of fear are sensations, feelings, cognitions and behaviours. Fear can be individual or collective such as expressed in the national fear in the United States related to terrorism. The Washington DC sniper attacks caused widespread fear in a large geographic region far out of proportion to the real danger. Individuals must cope with fear on a daily basis in a myriad of forms: financial fears, health fears, relationship conflict fears, dental appointments, fears about the future etc. This new book collects important research which helps shed light on important issues in this field which touches all of us each day.",2004,NA
35,Measurement in Social Psychology,"['Hart Blanton', 'Jessica M. LaCroix', 'Gregory D. Webster']","Although best known for experimental methods, social psychology also has a strong tradition of measurement. This volume seeks to highlight this tradition by introducing readers to measurement strategies that help drive social psychological research and theory development. The books opens with an analysis of the measurement technique that dominates most of the social sciences, self-report. Chapter 1 presents a conceptual framework for interpreting the data generated from self-report, which it uses to provide practical advice on writing strong and structured self-report items. From there, attention is drawn to the many other innovative measurement and data-collection techniques that have helped expand the range of theories social psychologists test. Chapters 2 through 6 introduce techniques designed to measure the internal psychological states of individual respondents, with strategies that can stand alone or complement anything obtained via self-report. Included are chapters on implicit, elicitation, and diary approaches to collecting response data from participants, as well as neurological and psychobiological approaches to inferring underlying mechanisms. The remaining chapters introduce creative data-collection techniques, focusing particular attention on the rich forms of data humans often leave behind. Included are chapters on textual analysis, archival analysis, geocoding, and social media harvesting. The many methods covered in this book complement one another, such that the full volume provides researchers with a powerful toolset to help them better explore what is ""social"" about human behavior.",2019,NA
36,The Happiness Hypothesis,['Jonathan Haidt'],"Every culture rests on a bedrock of folk wisdom handed down through generations. The pronouncements of philosophers are homespun by our grandmothers, and find their way into our common sense: what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Do unto others as you would have done unto you. Happiness comes from within. But are these 'truths' really true? Today we all seem to prefer to cling to the notion that a little bit more money, love or success will make us truly happy. Are we wrong? In The Happiness Hypothesis, psychologist Jonathan Haidt exposes traditional wisdom to the scrutiny of modern science, delivering startling insights. We learn that virtue is often not its own reward, why extroverts really are happier than introverts, and why conscious thought is not as important as we might like to think... Drawing on the rich inspiration of both philosophy and science, The Happiness Hypothesis is a remarkable, original and provocative book - ancient wisdom in our time.",2015-06-18,NA

Perceptions of fairness, and the factors that cause and are caused by fairness perceptions, have long been an important part of social psychology. Featuring work from leading scholars on psychological processes involved in reactions to fairness, as well as the applications of justice research to government institutions, policing, medical care and the development of radical and extremist behavior, the book expertly brings together two traditionally distinct branches of social psychology: social cognition and interpersonal relations. Examining how people judge whether the treatment they experience from others is fair and how this effects their attitudes and behaviors, this essential collection draws on theory and research from multiple disciplines as it explores the dynamics of fairness judgments and their consequences. Integrating theory on interpersonal relations and social cognition, and featuring innovative biological research, this is the ideal companion for senior undergraduates and graduates, as well as researchers and scholars interested in the social psychology of justice.",2019-12-03,NA

A commitment to cognitive dualism is destined to undermine the physical basis of behavior upon which evolutionary theory depends. Many evolutionary psychologists do not see this but are seduced by the easy way in which hypotheses can be formulated using the ‘propositional-attitude’ model.

15,Toward a Psychology of Being,"['Abraham H. Maslow', 'Richard Lowry']","""If we wish to help humans to become more fully human, we must realize not only that they try to realize themselves, but that they are also reluctant or afraid or unable to do so. Only by fully appreciating this dialectic between sickness and health can we help to tip the balance in favor of health."" --Abraham Maslow Abraham Maslow's theories of self-actualization and the hierarchy of human needs are the cornerstone of modern humanistic psychology, and no book so well epitomizes those ideas as his classic Toward a Psychology of Being. A profound book, an exciting book, its influence continues to spread, more than a quarter century after its author's death, beyond psychology and throughout the humanities, social theory, and business management theory. Of course, the book's enduring popularity stems from the important questions it raises and the answers it provides concerning what is fundamental to human nature and psychological well-being, and what is needed to promote, maintain, and restore mental and emotional well-being. But its success also has to do with Maslow's unique ability to convey difficult philosophical concepts with passion, precision, and astonishing clarity, and, through the power of his words, to ignite in readers a sense of creative joy and wholeness toward which we, as beings capable of self-actualization, strive. This Third Edition makes Abraham Maslow's ideas accessible to a new generation of psychology students, as well as businesspeople, managers, and trainers interested in applying the study of human behavior to management techniques. An energetic and articulate scholar, Professor Maslow was the author of more than twenty books, including Eupsychian Management; Psychology of Science; Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences; Motivation and Personality; and Principles of Abnormal Psychology (with B. Mittelmann). He also edited New Knowledge in Human Values and wrote nearly one hundred articles. His teachings continue to be a staple for psychologists and psychology students. ""Capacities clamor to be used, and cease their clamor only when they are well used. . . . Not only is it fun to use our capacities, but it is necessary for growth. The unused skill or capacity or organ can become a disease center or else atrophy or disappear, thus diminishing the person."" --Abraham Maslow Toward a Psychology of Being, Third Edition Abraham Maslow doesn't pretend to have easy answers, absolutes, or solutions that bring the relief of finality--but he does have a deep belief in people. In this Third Edition of Toward a Psychology of Being (the original edition sold well over 100,000 copies), there is a constant optimistic thrust toward a future based on the intrinsic values of humanity. Professor Maslow states that, ""This inner nature, as much as we know of it so far, seems not to be intrinsically evil, but rather either neutral or positively 'good.' What we call evil behavior appears most often to be a secondary reaction to frustration of this intrinsic nature."" He demonstrates that human beings can be loving, noble, and creative, and are capable of pursuing the highest values and aspirations. This Third Edition will bring Professor Maslow's ideas to a whole new generation of business and psychology readers, as well as anyone interested in the study of human behavior.",1998-11-23,NA

Addressing a range of sub-topics, the first section deals with the definition and measurement of aggression, presents major theories, examines the development of aggression and discusses individual and gender differences in aggressive behaviour. It covers the role of situational factors in eliciting aggression and the impact of exposure to violence in the media.

23,Mistakes Were Made (but Not by Me) Third Edition,"['Carol Tavris', 'Elliot Aronson']","A NEW EDITION UPDATED IN 2020 • Why is it so hard to say ""I made a mistake"" — and really believe it? When we make mistakes, cling to outdated attitudes, or mistreat other people, we must calm the cognitive dissonance that jars our feelings of self-worth. And so, unconsciously, we create fictions that absolve us of responsibility, restoring our belief that we are smart, moral, and right—a belief that often keeps us on a course that is dumb, immoral, and wrong. Backed by decades of research, Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me) offers a fascinating explanation of self-justification—how it works, the damage it can cause, and how we can overcome it. Extensively updated, this third edition has many recent and revealing examples, including the application of dissonance theory to divisive social issues such as the Black Lives Matter movement and he said/she said claims. It also features a new chapter that illuminates how cognitive dissonance is playing a role in the currently polarized political scene, changing the nation’s values and putting democracy itself at risk. “Every page sparkles with sharp insight and keen observation. Mistakes were made—but not in this book!” —Daniel Gilbert, author of Stumbling on Happiness “A revelatory study of how lovers, lawyers, doctors, politicians—and all of us—pull the wool over our own eyes . . .

26,Turning Psychology Into a Social Science,['Bernard Guerin'],"This radical book explores a new understanding of psychology based on human engagement with external contexts, rather than what goes on inside our heads. It is part of a trilogy which offers a new way of doing psychology focusing on people's social and societal environments as determining their behaviour, rather than internal and individualistic attributions. By showing that we engage directly with our complex social, political, economic, patriarchal, colonized and cultural contexts and that what we do and think arises from this direct engagement with these external contexts, Bernard Guerin expertly demonstrates that western ideas have systematically excluded the 'social' but that this is really where the major determinants of our behaviour arise. This book works through many human activities which psychology still treats as individualized and internal and shows their social and societal origins. These includes beliefs, the sense of self, the arts, religious behaviours, and the new and growing area of conservation psychology. The social structures found by sociology, anthropology and sociolinguistics are shown to shape most 'individual' human actions, and it is shown how the main points of Marxism and Indigenous knowledges can be better merged into this new and broader social science. Replacing the 'internal' attributions of causes with external contextual analyses based in the social sciences, this book is fascinating reading for academics and students in psychology and the social sciences, and provides exciting new ways to conceptualize and observe human actions in new ways and to resist the current individualistic thinking of 'psychology'.",2020-07-20,NA

Why are judges more likely to deny parole before lunch? Why do we assume a good-looking person will be more competent?

31,The Boy Between,"['Josiah Hartley', 'Amanda Prowse']","Bestselling novelist Amanda Prowse knew how to resolve a fictional family crisis. But then her son came to her with a real one... Josiah was nineteen with the world at his feet when things changed. Without warning, the new university student's mental health deteriorated to the point that he planned his own death. His mother, bestselling author Amanda Prowse, found herself grappling for ways to help him, with no clear sense of where that could be found. This is the book they wish had been there for them during those dark times. Josiah's situation is not unusual: the statistics on student mental health are terrifying. And he was not the only one suffering; his family was also hijacked by his illness, watching him struggle and fearing the day he might succeed in taking his life. In this book, Josiah and Amanda hope to give a voice to those who suffer, and to show them that help can be found. It is Josiah's raw, at times bleak, sometimes humorous, but always honest account of what it is like to live with depression. It is Amanda's heart-rending account of her pain at watching him suffer, speaking from the heart about a mother's love for her child. For anyone with depression and anyone who loves someone with depression, Amanda and Josiah have a clear message--you are not alone, and there is hope.",2020-11,NA

20,The Power of Habit,['Charles Duhigg'],"Groundbreaking new research shows that by grabbing hold of the three-step ""loop"" all habits form in our brains--cue, routine, reward--we can change them, giving us the power to take control over our lives. ""We are what we repeatedly do,"" said Aristotle. ""Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."" On the most basic level, a habit is a simple neurological loop: there is a cue (my mouth feels gross), a routine (hello, Crest), and a reward (ahhh, minty fresh). Understanding this loop is the key to exercising regularly or becoming more productive at work or tapping into reserves of creativity. Marketers, too, are learning how to exploit these loops to boost sales; CEOs and coaches are using them to change how employees work and athletes compete. As this book shows, tweaking even one habit, as long as it's the right one, can have staggering effects. In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes readers inside labs where brain scans record habits as they flourish and die; classrooms in which students learn to boost their willpower; and boardrooms where executives dream up products that tug on our deepest habitual urges. Full of compelling narratives that will appeal to fans of Michael Lewis, Jonah Lehrer, and Chip and Dan Heath, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: our most basic actions are not the product of well-considered decision making, but of habits we often do not realize exist. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our lives.",2012-02-28,NA

29,A First Book in Psychology,['Mary Whiton Calkins'],"""This book has been written in the ever strengthening conviction that psychology is most naturally, consistently, and effectively treated as a study of conscious selves in relation to other selves and to external objects--in a word, to their environment, personal and impersonal. However he defines his science, every psychologist talks and writes about selves--of myself and yourself--as conscious of people, of things, or of laws and formulae. The psychology of self, which this book sets forth, is a conscious adoption and scientific exposition of this natural and practically inevitable conception. In general, I have tried to make a simpler, more direct approach to the subject. In the earlier book, I treated psychology in a twofold fashion, both as science of selves and as science of ideas (or 'mental processes'), discussing all forms of consciousness from both points of view. I have here abandoned this double treatment, with the intent to simplify exposition, not because I doubt the validity of psychology as study of ideas, but because I question the significance and the adequacy, and deprecate the abstractness, of the science thus conceived. In a second fashion this book differs from the other. I have tried to embody what appear to me to be the important results of so-called functional psychology. That is to say, I have taken explicit account of the characteristic bodily reactions on environment which accompany perception, thought, emotion, and will; and I have briefly considered the various forms of consciousness as factors in conduct, and as significant in individual and in social development""--Preface.

32,Psychology,['Gregory A. Kimble'],"At a time in the history of psychology when many psychologists are troubled by the splintered condition of the field, Gregory Kimble proposes that the diverse perspectives in psychology share ways of thinking that can bring coherence to the discipline. Drawing on years of extensive research and scholarship (including a deep familiarity with the writings of William James and many psychologists who have succeeded him in a search for unity in psychological theorizing), Kimble presents evidence for this potential unity. He portrays psychology as a natural science with relevance to human life and offers a set of axioms that hold the field together. Psychology is a two-part exploration of the concept of psychology as the science of behavior. The first part describes the traditional commitments of the scientific method and spells out the implications of those commitments for psychology. The second part develops a general theory within a framework that can be called functional behaviorism, which combines the imperative that a science of psychology must be about observable realities with the view that human behavior is the result of evolution. Kimble's proposals are of general significance and have stood the test of time: they were reasonably explicit in the writings of the giants in the history of psychology, and they apply in contexts that range from behavioral neurology to social action.

The book is divided into nine sections that examine traditional themes (social construction and deconstruction of diversity, intergenerational transitions and memories of war, and multiculturalism), as well as contemporary issues such as Europe’s “migration crisis”, radicalization and violent extremism, and violence in families, schools and communities. Chapters contextualize each issue within specific social ecological frameworks in order to reflect on the multiplicity of influences that affect different outcomes and to discuss how the findings can be applied in different contexts. The volume also provides solutions and hope through its focus on youth empowerment and peacebuilding programs for children and families. This forward-thinking volume offers a multitude of views, approaches, and strategies for research and activism drawn from peace psychology scholars and United Nations researchers and practitioners.

35,The New Psychology of Health,"['Catherine Haslam', 'Jolanda Jetten', 'Tegan Cruwys', 'Genevieve Dingle', 'Alex Haslam']","Why do people who are more socially connected live longer and have better health than those who are socially isolated? Why are social ties at least as good for your health as not smoking, having a good diet, and taking regular exercise? Why is treatment more effective when there is an alliance between therapist and client? Until now, researchers and practitioners have lacked a strong theoretical foundation for answering such questions. This ground-breaking book fills this gap by showing how social identity processes are key to understanding and effectively managing a broad range of health-related problems. Integrating a wealth of evidence that the authors and colleagues around the world have built up over the last decade, The New Psychology of Health provides a powerful framework for reconceptualising the psychological dimensions of a range of conditions – including stress, trauma, ageing, depression, addiction, eating behaviour, brain injury, and pain. Alongside reviews of current approaches to these various issues, each chapter provides an in-depth analysis of the ways in which theory and practice can be enriched by attention to social identity processes. Here the authors show not only how an array of social and structural factors shape health outcomes through their impact on group life, but also how this analysis can be harnessed to promote the delivery of ‘social cures’ in a range of fields.

39,Beginning Psychology,['Charles Stangor'],"This book is part of a small project by Andy Schmitz to archive copies of all the books which were made available online from a specific publisher at the end of 2012 in order to preserve their status as Creative Commons-licensed textbooks and therefore remain free to access and use. Schmitz explains why there are no authors, publisher names or descriptions:The books are licensed under the Creative Commons by-nc-sa 3.0 license, which typically requires attributing the source of the work (author, title, and URI). Initially, then, these books were attributed to the authors and publisher who made them available. However, in March 2013, I was contacted by the publisher, who, acting as the licensor of the works, asked me to remove the Creative Commons attribution to the original authors and publisher from the collection of books. They also indicated that, in situations where I was required to attribute the work, they wished the works to be attributed to anonymous authors. While I find this turn of events disappointing because it doesn't give the publisher or the original authors very much credit for for making the books available, I have obliged by removing the original attribution I had added for Creative Commons, and by not specifying the publisher's name in my templates for the books. What about the titles?In August 2013, I was contacted again by the publisher, who requested that I remove the books' original titles as well. Under the understanding that the books republished here are a Collection, and that the title in the book URIs could be considered part of the Section 4(d) attribution, I have retitled all of the books hosted in this collection. Care has been taken to ensure that links to the old names in this collection will redirect to the book's new location, and to the same content. Further, the publisher requested that I remove their ""corporate trademarks"" from the books. I have therefore also replaced the publisher's name with the phrase ""Unnamed Publisher"" and a link to this page. And the citations?A number of the books in this archive had citations to other books from the publisher, or other resources that the publisher was hosting. As part of the publisher's requests, they asked to have these citations and links removed as well. Because it did not appear as though the removal of the citations was likely to impact the books' usability, where I have found citations to books from the publisher, I have removed those citations as well.",2012,NA

Few people had a chance to age. Today, thanks to extraordinary medical, demographic, and economic shifts, most of us expect to live long lives. Consequently, the world is witnessing a powerful new version of retirement, driven by the power and needs of the Baby Boomer generation. Consumers over age 50 account for more than half of all spending and control more than 70% of our total net worth – yet are largely ignored by youth-focused marketers. How will work, family, and retirement be transformed to accommodate two billion people over the age of 60 worldwide? In the coming years, we’ll see explosive business growth fueled by this unprecedented longevity revolution. What Retirees Want presents the culmination of 30 years of research by world-famous ""Age Wave"" expert Ken Dychtwald, Ph.D., and author and consultant Robert Morison. It explains how the aging of the Baby Boomers will forever change our lives, businesses, government programs, and the consumer marketplace. This exciting new stage of life, the ""Third Age,"" poses daunting questions: What will ""old"" look like in the years ahead? With continued advances in longevity, all of the traditional life-stage markers and boundaries will need to be adjusted. What new products and services will boom as a result of this coming longevity revolution? What unconscious ageist marketing practices are hurting people – and business growth? Will the majority of elder boomers outlive their pensions and retirement savings and how can this financial disaster be prevented? What incredible new technologies of medicine, life extension, and human enhancement await us in the near future? What purposeful new roles can we create for elder boomers so that the aging nations of the Americas, Europe, and Asia capitalize on the upsides of aging? Which pioneering organizations and companies worldwide have created marketing strategies and programs that resonate with the quirky and demanding Boomer generation? In this entertaining, thought-provoking, and wide-ranging book, Dychtwald and Morison explain how individuals, businesses, non-profits, and governments can best prepare for a new era – where the needs and demands of the ""Third Age"" will set the lifestyle, health, social, marketplace, and political priorities of generations to come.",2020-07-15,NA

30,Emerging Adulthood,['Jeffrey Jensen Arnett'],"Recently the lives of people from age 18 to 29 have changed so dramatically that a new stage of life has developed, emerging adulthood, that is distinct from both the adolescence that precedes it and the young adulthood that comes in its wake. Rather than marrying and becoming parents in their early twenties, most people in industrialized societies now postpone these transitions until at least their late twenties, and instead spend the time in self-focused exploration as they try out different possibilities in their careers and relationships. In Emerging Adulthood, Jeffrey Jensen Arnett identifies and labels, for the first time, this period exploration, instability, possibility, self-focus, and a sustained sense of being in limbo. An increasing number of emerging adults emphasize having meaningful and satisfying work to a degree not seen in prior generations. Marrying later and exploring more casual sexual relationships have created different hopes and fears concerning long-term commitments and the differences between love and sex. Emerging adults also face the challenge of defending their non-traditional lifestyles to parents and others outside their generation who have made much more traditional choices. In contrast to previous portrayals of emerging adults, Arnett's research shows that they are particularly skilled at maintaining contradictory emotions--they are confident while still being wary, and optimistic in the face of large degrees of uncertainty. As the demographics of American youth, the American workplace, and adulthood continue to evolve, Emerging Adulthood is indispensable reading for anyone wanting to understand the face of modern America.",2006-06-01,NA

9,The New Psychology of Leadership,"['S. Alexander Haslam', 'Stephen D. Reicher', 'Michael J. Platow']","Winner of the University of San Diego Outstanding Leadership Book Award 2012! Shortlisted for the British Psychological Society Book Award 2011! Shortlisted for the CMI (Chartered Management Institute) Management Book of the Year Award 2011–2012! According to John Adair, the most important word in the leader's vocabulary is ""we"" and the least important word is ""I"". But if this is true, it raises one important question: why do psychological analyses of leadership always focus on the leader as an individual – as the great ""I""? One answer is that theorists and practitioners have never properly understood the psychology of ""we-ness"". This book fills this gap by presenting a new psychology of leadership that is the result of two decades of research inspired by social identity and self-categorization theories. The book argues that to succeed, leaders need to create, champion, and embed a group identity in order to cultivate an understanding of 'us' of which they themselves are representative. It also shows how, by doing this, they can make a material difference to the groups, organizations, and societies that they lead. Written in an accessible and engaging style, the book examines a range of central theoretical and practical issues, including the nature of group identity, the basis of authority and legitimacy, the dynamics of justice and fairness, the determinants of followership and charisma, and the practice and politics of leadership. The book will appeal to academics, practitioners and students in social and organizational psychology, sociology, political science and anyone interested in leadership, influence and power.",2010-09-13,NA

This landmark study considers the problematic relationship between development and psychology, tracing the deployment of psychological knowledge in the production/reproduction of power relations within the context of neoliberal development policy and intervention. It examines knowledge production and implementation by actors of development policy such as the World Bank and the neo-colonial state - and ends by examining the proposition of a critical psychology for more emancipatory forms of development. The role of psychology in development studies remains a relatively unexplored area, with limited scholarship available. This important book aims to fill that gap by using critical psychology perspectives to explore the focus of the psychological domain of agency in development interventions. It will be essential reading for students, researchers, and policy makers from fields including critical psychology, social psychology, development studies and anthropology. """,2016-10-04,NA
14,Never Enough,"[""Michael D'Antonio""]","In the summer of 2015, as he vaulted to the lead among the many GOP candidates for president, Donald Trump was the only one dogged by questions about his true intentions. This most famous American businessman had played the role of provocateur so often that pundits, reporters, and voters struggled to believe that he was a serious contender. Trump stirred so much controversy that his candidacy puzzled anyone who applied ordinary political logic to the race. But as Michael D'Antonio shows in Never Enough, Trump has rarely been ordinary in his pursuit of success and his trademark method is based on a logic that begins with his firm belief that he is a singular and superior human being. As revealed in this landmark biography, Donald Trump is a man whose appetite for wealth, attention, power, and conquest is practically insatiable. Declaring that he is still the person he was as a rascally little boy, Trump confesses that he avoids reflecting on himself ""because I might not like what I see"" and he believes ""most people aren't worthy of respect."" A product of the media age and the Me Generation that emerged in the 1970s, Trump was a Broadway showman before he became a developer. Mentored by the scoundrel attorney Roy Cohn, Trump was a regular on the New York club scene and won press attention as a dashing young mogul before he had built his first major project. He leveraged his father's enormous fortune and political connections to get his business off the ground, and soon developed a larger-than-life persona. In time, and through many setbacks, he made himself into a living symbol of extravagance and achievement. Drawing upon extensive and exclusive interviews with Trump and many of his family members, including all his adult children, D'Antonio presents the full story of a truly American icon, from his beginnings as a businessman to his stormy romantic life and his pursuit of power in its many forms. For all those who wonder: Just who is Donald Trump?, Never Enough supplies the answer. He is a promoter, builder, performer and politician who pursues success with a drive that borders on obsession and yet, has given him, almost everything he ever wanted.",2015-09-22,NA

19,Moral Psychology,['Walter Sinnott-Armstrong'],"Leading philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists address issues of moral responsibility and free will, drawing on new findings from empirical science. Traditional philosophers approached the issues of free will and moral responsibility through conceptual analysis that seldom incorporated findings from empirical science. In recent decades, however, striking developments in psychology and neuroscience have captured the attention of many moral philosophers. This volume of Moral Psychology offers essays, commentaries, and replies by leading philosophers and scientists who explain and use empirical findings from psychology and neuroscience to illuminate old and new problems regarding free will and moral responsibility. The contributors—who include such prominent scholars as Patricia Churchland, Daniel Dennett, and Michael Gazzaniga—consider issues raised by determinism, compatibilism, and libertarianism; epiphenomenalism, bypassing, and naturalism; naturalism; and rationality and situationism. These writings show that although science does not settle the issues of free will and moral responsibility, it has enlivened the field by asking novel, profound, and important questions.

23,Between Psychology and Psychotherapy (Psychology Revivals),['Miller Mair'],"In this highly original and thought-provoking work the late Miller Mair puts forward his ideas for a new psychology. First published in 1989, he deals with issues of fundamental importance to the future of a psychology guided by genuine enquiry and concern rather than mere professional self-interest. Crossing and re-crossing boundaries between psychology, psychotherapy and philosophy, and between 'science' and 'art', he demonstrates the linkages between the personal and the impersonal, subject and object, inside and outside, with a daring not previously risked by anyone working in the area. Dr Mair stresses the importance of a poetic approach in psychology and psychotherapy, and the need to explore and understand the nature of psychology through an imaginative freedom of language. He emphasizes that a poetic awareness and attentiveness is fundamental to any pursuit of understanding of ourselves or others. This is a very personal book, concerned with personal knowledge, but it is meant for anyone who seeks to understand themselves and others, and what is involved in coming to such understanding. Focusing on ordinary human experience, and moving towards literary and artistic modes of expression, the author invites you to enter in, follow what you think and feel, as he proposes a radical revision of much that is accepted in psychology and in psychotherapy.",2014-12-01,NA

His studies revealed that what makes experience genuinely satisfying is 'flow' - a state of concentration so focused that it amounts to complete absorption in an activity and results in the achievement of a perfect state of happiness. Flow has become the classic work on happiness and a major contribution to contemporary psychology. It examines such timeless issues as the challenge of lifelong learning; family relationships; art, sport and sex as 'flow'; the pain of loneliness; optimal use of free time; and how to make our lives meaningful.",2013-11-15,NA
27,Foundation of Psychology As a Scientific Discipline,['Steven Carley'],"It seems as if most of behavioral science students and researchers seem to be partial to general psychology. Most of us possess of a psychology background making understanding of the study of behavior and mind more simple. Still, evil satanic three headed dog warriors seem to drive psychology into our brains in the application of the complex task of gaining expertise within the domain. The results are rather messy. Our weapon in understanding psychology is the computer permitting us to circumvent the difficulty of any lack of understanding. The computer to a three-headed dog satanic warrior possesses a similar effect of catnip on the cat. This effect is a ceaseless dribble and purring creature rubbing its head along the ground. The downside of the computer is one can make an idiot of him or herself should they not possess an adequate understanding. Despite this the computer can be a tool of utility within the psychology chest. The aim of my book is to create a balance among practice and theory. The goal is to make of utility the computer as a teaching implement for psychological concepts in the hope you can establish a greater knowledge of practice and theory. Many books, it seems attempt to establish an impression of the right and wrong way of viewing psychology. Although recommendations which are within the limits of the senseless destruction of rain forests, the hope is to provide background in the theoretical concept of psychology permitting you to create decisions about how to best view the domain. A 2nd aim of the book is to create the only psychology book you'll ever need. It is my hope that my book can be your friend during your 1st year at the university level carrying through to your professorship. The book is very much no nonsense, like me, with the first 3 chapters covering self-psychology, social psychology, and biological psychology. This is followed by chapters on motivation and historical figures within the domain. The next 3 chapters discuss mathematical computation and the human brain and nutrition. Chapters 9, 10, and 11 discuss operant and classical conditioning along with aspects of race and case studies involving Schiavo, O'Brien, and Gage. Chapter 12 and 13 cover relationships and stress with 14 and 15 discussing learning/memory along with dreams. The book closes out with three chapters involving sexuality with the final two chapters involving physiological disorders and mental illness. Within each chapter should be something for all. The most important and final aim is making the process of learning fun, despite the content being of mostly serious subject matter. To be honest, it is difficult to credit my academic ability to others such as family. This being a testimony of me being as far as I know the first college graduate, at least for a while. I guess I may thank teachers along the way if anyone. Many of the book's examples, the inspiration as the craziness of the real world are a reflection of topics the average student should be aware exists within the domain. My book is not an attempt of undermining the seriousness of science as you will notice on gazing through some of the content. Perhaps I could have added a joke or a humorous picture here or there, yet in light of some of the subject matter, the decision is to remain more focused on the subject matter and less on showcasing the author's personality. I am sure previous editions of this book to not meet the aim. This is the book initiating my collection of literature, yet one of the last in which I take the personal time to reach the aim of the book. If anyone should feel the necessity to email me and tell me how wonderful I am, you are more than welcome to do so: sgc14x@email.phoenix.edu or steven.carley@snhu.edu. There are no threats of me ruining the hard work of my previous editions with the creation of this final version, hopefully final version.

Even when we recognize good ideas, applying them to everyday obstacles—whether in the workplace, our homes, or our civic institutions—can seem insurmountable. According to Matthew Syed, it doesn't have to be this way. In Rebel Ideas, Syed argues that our brainpower as individuals isn't enough. To tackle problems from climate change to economic decline, we'll need to employ the power of ""cognitive diversity."" Drawing on psychology, genetics, and beyond, Syed uses real-world scenarios including the failings of the CIA before 9/11 and a communication disaster at the peak of Mount Everest to introduce us to the true power of thinking differently. Rebel Ideas will strengthen any kind of team, while including advice on how, as individuals, we can embrace the potential of an ""outsider mind-set"" as our greatest asset.

These questions include: What is the nature of compassion? How does compassion differ from other emotions, such as empathy, pity, or gratitude? Is compassion a virtue? Can we have too much compassion? How does compassion influence other mental states (desires, motivations, beliefs, and intentions) and behaviour? How is compassion influenced by the environment? Must compassion be deserved? Can one be moral while lacking the capacity for compassion? Compassion, like other emotions, has many facets - biological, social, psychological and neural, among others.

2,Hooked,['Nir Eyal'],"Revised and Updated, Featuring a New Case Study How do successful companies create products people can’t put down? Why do some products capture widespread attention while others flop? What makes us engage with certain products out of sheer habit? Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us? Nir Eyal answers these questions (and many more) by explaining the Hook Model—a four-step process embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly encourage customer behavior. Through consecutive “hook cycles,” these products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging. Hooked is based on Eyal’s years of research, consulting, and practical experience. He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up founder—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better products. Hooked is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behavior. Eyal provides readers with: • Practical insights to create user habits that stick. • Actionable steps for building products people love. • Fascinating examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other habit-forming products.",2014-11-04,NA

4,Hallucination,"['Fiona Macpherson', 'Dimitris Platchias']","Scientific and philosophical perspectives on hallucination: essays that draw on empirical evidence from psychology, neuroscience, and cutting-edge philosophical theory. Reflection on the nature of hallucination has relevance for many traditional philosophical debates concerning the nature of the mind, perception, and our knowledge of the world. In recent years, neuroimaging techniques and scientific findings on the nature of hallucination, combined with interest in new philosophical theories of perception such as disjunctivism, have brought the topic of hallucination once more to the forefront of philosophical thinking. Scientific evidence from psychology, neuroscience, and psychiatry sheds light on the functional role and physiology of actual hallucinations; some disjunctivist theories offer a radically new and different philosophical conception of hallucination. This volume offers interdisciplinary perspectives on the nature of hallucination, offering essays by both scientists and philosophers. Contributors first consider topics from psychology and neuroscience, including neurobiological mechanisms of hallucination and the nature and phenomenology of auditory-verbal hallucinations. Philosophical discussions follow, with contributors first considering disjunctivism and then, more generally, the relation between hallucination and the nature of experience.

10,The Hidden Brain,['Shankar Vedantam'],"What if it is simply unconscious biases — in the way of memory, emotion and attention — that produce most misunderstandings and conflicts between people, groups and even nations? How can you tell if it isn't just your brain running on 'auto-pilot' that makes your moral decisions for you, instead of the logical thinking you've nurtured and developed? Reminiscent of Malcolm Gladwell's Blink, The Hidden Brain takes a look at how we actually think both consciously and unconsciously. In The Hidden Brain: how our unconscious minds elect presidents, control markets, wage wars, and save our lives, author and science journalist Shankar Vedantam describes unique cases of everyday unconscious decision making while applying the latest scientific studies to each situation. The result is fascinating. The Hidden Brain explores numerous questions and doubts about the choices we make and updates us on the most recent scientific research on unconscious thinking. Shankar believes most everything we do boils down to the inner workings of our brains. Most human actions are based on unconscious biases, not conscious decisions. Looking into 'the hidden brain' is how he can best explain, scientifically, the many contradictory and illogical things people say and do, regardless of their ability to reason. Shankar's recent journalism enables the lay-person to understand what the scientific and human behaviorist communities are discovering. And his book delves into a wide variety of stories that intriguingly point toward the astounding notion that people are much more dependent on the unconscious than most of us would like to believe, by linking this research to real life situations. If it isn't the unconscious how else do you explain biases that prompt us to think that a black woman leaning over a hospital bed is a nurse, rather than a surgeon? How do you explain why well-meaning managers choose some candidates for job interviews while eliminating others who are equally qualified? Can you explain why people don't always run out of a burning building?",2010,NA

The book argues that it was a period that that bridged the ancient with the modern, ignorance with knowledge and superstition with science. The Middle Ages spanned almost a millennium in the history of the humanities and provided the people of this period with the benefit of this knowledge. The book looks at the promise and progress which was reflected by thinkers such as Augustin and Aurelianus, Alexander of Tralles and Paul of Aegina. The book also looks at martyrs like Valentine and Dympna, and the patrons of those afflicted with illnesses such as epilepsy and insanity. Written by the psychologist Thomas Francis Graham, this book provides a distinct and unique insight into the mind of those living in the medieval period and will be of interest to academics of history and literature alike.",2019-07-12,NA

Along the way, Jon meets psychopaths, those whose lives have been touched by madness and those whose job it is to diagnose it, including the influential psychologist who developed the Psychopath Test, from whom Jon learns the art of psychopath-spotting. A skill which seemingly reveals that madness could indeed be at the heart of everything . . .

After just a few seconds, a man dressed as a gorilla slowly walked into frame, beat his chest at the camera, and sauntered off. Unbelievably, almost none of the people watching the film noticed the gorilla. Exactly the same psychological mechanisms that cause people to miss the gorilla also make them miss unexpected but vitally important opportunities in their professional and personal lives.

She invites you to follow her into all sorts of mortifying moments, drawing on personal experience and in-depth psychological research to answer questions you've probably pondered at some point, such as: * Why are situations without clear rules most likely to turn awkward? * Are people really judging us as harshly as we think they are? * Does anyone ever truly outgrow their awkward teenage self? If you can learn to tolerate life's most awkward situations -- networking, difficult conversations, hearing the sound of your own terrible voice -- your awkwardness can be a secret weapon to making better, more memorable impressions.

Their dedication and hard work have yielded an authoritative volume that defines and classifies mental disorders in order to improve diagnoses, treatment, and research. The criteria are concise and explicit, intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations in a variety of clinical settings -- inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. New features and enhancements make DSM-5® easier to use across all settings: The chapter organization reflects a lifespan approach, with disorders typically diagnosed in childhood (such as neurodevelopmental disorders) at the beginning of the manual, and those more typical of older adults (such as neurocognitive disorders) placed at the end. Also included are age-related factors specific to diagnosis. The latest findings in neuroimaging and genetics have been integrated into each disorder along with gender and cultural considerations. The revised organizational structure recognizes symptoms that span multiple diagnostic categories, providing new clinical insight in diagnosis. Specific criteria have been streamlined, consolidated, or clarified to be consistent with clinical practice (including the consolidation of autism disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder into autism spectrum disorder; the streamlined classification of bipolar and depressive disorders; the restructuring of substance use disorders for consistency and clarity; and the enhanced specificity for major and mild neurocognitive disorders). Dimensional assessments for research and validation of clinical results have been provided. Both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes are included for each disorder, and the organizational structure is consistent with the new ICD-11 in development. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, is the most comprehensive, current, and critical resource for clinical practice available to today's mental health clinicians and researchers of all orientations.

Edith Eger’s powerful first book The Choice told the story of her survival in the concentration camps, her escape, healing, and journey to freedom. Oprah Winfrey says, “I will be forever changed by Dr. Eger’s story.” Thousands of people around the world have written to Eger to tell her how The Choice moved them and inspired them to confront their own past and try to heal their pain; and to ask her to write another, more “how-to” book. Now, in The Gift, Eger expands on her message of healing and provides a hands-on guide that gently encourages us to change the thoughts and behaviors that may be keeping us imprisoned in the past. Eger explains that the worst prison she experienced is not the prison that Nazis put her in but the one she created for herself, the prison within her own mind. She describes the twelve most pervasive imprisoning beliefs she has known—including fear, grief, anger, secrets, stress, guilt, shame, and avoidance—and the tools she has discovered to deal with these universal challenges. Accompanied by stories from Eger’s own life and the lives of her patients each chapter includes thought-provoking questions and takeaways, such as: -Would you like to be married to you? -Are you evolving or revolving? -You can’t heal what you can’t feel.

31,Behavioral Insights for Public Policy,['Kai Ruggeri'],"The first decades of the 21st century have offered a remarkable shift in how policies are made as well as who designs them. Until this period, local, regional, and national policy advisors largely comprised economists, lawyers, and financial experts. But in an era when behavioral scientists are increasingly being asked to demonstrate the impact of their research, many are playing a much greater role in policy making across a range of sectors as a result. Written by a team of authors working across both academia and government, Behavioral Insights for Public Policy is the first textbook to fully examine how psychology can be applied to a range of public policy areas. It addresses a wide variety of topics from the origins of policy as well as major findings from behavioral economics and nudge theory, to large-scale applications of behavioral insights. The compilation is the first of its kind to broadly cover the underlying theory, history, major empirical examples, and practical applications to policy of nudges (or behavioral insights) for teaching and study in higher education. Featuring over 100 empirical examples of how behavioral insights are being used to address some of the most critical challenges faced globally, the book also includes a unique chapter from an organization actively implementing behavioral insights in policies along with various government institutions.

34,Clinical Psychology,"['Susan P. Llewelyn', 'Katie Aafjes-Van Doorn']","Clinical psychology makes a significant contribution to mental health care across the world. The essence of the discipline is the creative application of the knowledge base of psychology to the unique, personal experiences of individuals who are facing difficulties or changes in their lives. Rather than addressing such experiences as primarily a medical, political or legal problem, clinical psychologists approach personal distress as an unhappy outcome of certain ways of thinking, behaving and relating, often occurring within difficult social, cultural or economic circumstances. Clinical psychologists work with people to try and help them change what is distressing or concerning them, based on a belief in the value of the individual to determine what happens to them and on the importance of using approaches which have been demonstrated through research to be effective. In this Very Short Introduction Susan Llewellyn and Katie Aafjes-van Doorn provide insights into the world of clinical psychologists and their clients or patients, and cover the range of domains of practice, the difficulties tackled, and the approaches and models used. They consider the challenges and controversies facing the profession today, and also how it varies across the globe. Finally, they discuss the key questions surrounding clinical psychology, such as whether it should compete or collaborate with psychiatry, how far it is yet another instrument of social control, what new technology can offer in the future, and whether clinical psychology can ever really be considered a science. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

Although open to authors from all nations, one of its major purposes is to further the international exchange of ideas by providing an outlet for substantial accounts of theoretical and empirical work that has not been previously published in English. With the help of an editorial board consisting of senior scholars from various European countries and the United States, the editors will invite outstanding researchers to contribute to these volumes. The emphasis of these contributions will be on critical assessment of major areas of research, and substantial individual programmes of research as well as on topics and initiatives of contemporary interest and originality. The authors of this second volume are drawn from Europe and the United States. They represent the international scope and quality which the editors intend should become the hallmarks of this series.",1991,NA
