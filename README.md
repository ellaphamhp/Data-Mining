# Data-Mining

#This folder contains several sub-projects that I created: 

FOLDER - Domain Knowledge Explorer: 
- This folder contains the source code for my Domain Knowledge Explore web app, which allows user to explore the most popular words related to a domain knowledge.
The most popular words are retrieved based on the first 300 books in Google Book database that contain the topic name in its title. The app will query all description of these books, caculate the frequency each word appears in this library and returns the most popular terms. 

Other files: These are independent files, not related to each other. Each is a mini project related to web scraping, text processing.
- These are Jupyter Notebooks I created to practice scraping book data from the internet.
- Some files contain the code which I later adopted for the web app for Domain Knowledge Explorer
- There's also a notebook where I wrote code to extract the most popular words from any pdf document.
